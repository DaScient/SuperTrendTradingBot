# Super Trend Trading Bot  

Welcome to the [@donutz.ai](https://donutz.ai) automated trading protocol! This bot leverages cutting-edge **Reinforcement Learning ensembles**, the **SuperTrend indicator**, **Kalman Filter Forecasting**, **Simple & Exponential Moving Averages**, **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**, and other robust technical indicators to generate intelligent trade signals. It calculates and suggests profitable buy/sell orders for both **Robinhood** and **Binance.US** platforms using **Python**.  

This project is an open-source playground for data scientists, quants, and trading enthusiasts alike. **Fork**, **tweak**, **experiment**, and **enhance** to your heart's content! The underlying decision science and forecasting principles here are widely applicable across predictive modeling, time-series analysis, and machine learning efforts well beyond trading and asset management. We only ask you to credit this repository and respect our community's guidelines.  

For detailed insights into the bot's development and functionality, check out this [Medium publication](https://medium.com/coinmonks/daily-binance-us-crypto-trade-signals-fda4e8a205c8) and this [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dascient/daily-crypto-buy-sell-decision-maker), which showcases automated decision-making in action.

## **Current Development Goals**  

1. **Incorporate Social Sentiment Analysis**: Bringing the pulse of the market to your trades.  
2. **Add Advanced Indicators**: Expanding our suite of technical tools.  
3. **Pre-Built Trading Strategies**: Allow users to select and deploy strategies tailored to their goals.  
4. **Community Portfolio Mirroring**: Users can create, share, and mirror peer portfolios for collective success.  
5. **Autonomous Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the bot’s decision-making as it learns and adapts over time.  

We aim to optimize returns, minimize losses, and make trading as straightforward (and enjoyable) as possible. Join us in building a platform for traders of all levels—because making smarter trades shouldn’t be intimidating.

## **SuperTrend Features** :computer:  

### **Trends**  
This unique feature lets users partially or fully mirror portfolio allocations of others in the community. Explore strategies, join public groups, or even create your own portfolios to share. When a group leader updates their allocations, all connected portfolios will automatically reflect the changes! It’s like being part of a live, dynamic investment team—designed for all risk appetites.

## **The Bot: SuperTrend in a Nutshell** :robot:  

The bot is organized into three main components:  

1. **Data Class**: Handles live market data, including candlestick (OHLC) feeds and key indicators.  
2. **Trade Strategy Class**: A modular system allowing users to experiment with various trading strategies.  
3. **Execution Class**: Converts trade signals into live orders on Binance.US via the CCXT library.
