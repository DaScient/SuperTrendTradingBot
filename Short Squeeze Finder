The script should calculate potential returns and estimate when the short squeeze is expected to begin based on certain market signals.\n","\n","Here's an outline of what the script will do:\n","\n","Analyze data to detect short squeeze opportunities. A short squeeze typically happens when the price of a stock rises sharply, forcing traders who have bet against the stock (short sellers) to buy shares to cover their positions, further driving the price up. This can be detected by analyzing indicators like:\n","Short Interest Ratio: Percentage of shares that are shorted relative to the float.\n","Price Action: Price rising rapidly after consolidation or downward trend.\n","Volume: Unusually high volume relative to previous periods.\n","Display the results: List out potential short squeeze candidates, their expected return, and an estimated time when the squeeze could occur based on historical patterns."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"7b3741e5","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-07T20:04:45.742863Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-07T20:04:45.742454Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-07T20:04:52.181749Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-07T20:04:52.180274Z"},"papermill":{"duration":6.44438,"end_time":"2025-01-07T20:04:52.183763","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-01-07T20:04:45.739383","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["from
