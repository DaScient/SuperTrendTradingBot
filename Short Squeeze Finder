The script should calculate potential returns and estimate when the short squeeze is expected to begin based on certain market signals.\n\nHere's an outline of what the script will do:\n\nAnalyze data to detect short squeeze opportunities. A short squeeze typically happens when the price of a stock rises sharply, forcing traders who have bet against the stock (short sellers) to buy shares to cover their positions, further driving the price up. This can be detected by analyzing indicators like:\nShort Interest Ratio: Percentage of shares that are shorted relative to the float.\nPrice Action: Price rising rapidly after consolidation or downward trend.\nVolume: Unusually high volume relative to previous periods.\nDisplay the results: List out potential short squeeze candidates, their expected return, and an estimated time when the squeeze could occur based on historical patterns.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import clear_output\n!pip install yfinance pandas\nclear_output()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-07T19:48:01.818208Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-07T19:48:01.818657Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-07T19:48:06.665436Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-07T19:48:01.818626Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-07T19:48:06.664008Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import clear_output\n!pip install yfinance pandas\nclear_output()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Short Squeezes For The Day\")\ndf","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-07T20:06:02.962492Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-07T20:06:02.962943Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-07T20:06:02.987270Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-07T20:06:02.962914Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-07T20:06:02.986086Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# en fin","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
